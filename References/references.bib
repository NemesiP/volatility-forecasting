  abstract    = {We introduce Mixed Data Sampling (henceforth MIDAS) regression models. The regressions involve time series data sampled at different frequencies. Technically speaking MIDAS models specify conditional expectations as a distributed lag of regressors recorded at some higher sampling frequencies. We examine the asymptotic properties of MIDAS regression estimation and compare it with traditional distributed lag models. MIDAS regressions have wide applicability in macroeconomics and finance. Nous introduisons des modèles de régression MIDAS (Mixed Data Sampling). Ce sont des modèles de régression avec des séries temporelles échantillonées à différentes fréquences. Nous analysons les liens avec les modèles à retards échelonnés.},

  abstract = {A typical MIDAS regression involves estimating parameters via nonlinear least squares, unless U-MIDAS is applied – which involves OLS – the latter being appealing when the sampling frequency differences are small. It is proposed to use OLS estimation of the MIDAS regression slope and intercept parameters combined with profiling the polynomial weighting scheme parameter(s). The use of Beta polynomials is particularly attractive for such an approach. The new procedure shares many of the desirable features of U-MIDAS, while it is not restricted to small sampling frequency differences.},
